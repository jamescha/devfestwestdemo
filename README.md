Devfest West 2012 Dart-Game
GDG Gangnam style Game

This is the my first attempt to use Dart to make a game. I started this at the Google DevFest West Hackathon event and won the event with it.

It uses Dart's converted version of Box2D Physics.

All rights to the Gangnam Sytle idea, song, theme, everything is not owned by me but Psy and all who are involved with it. Thank you.

This is the project for launching to Appspot
